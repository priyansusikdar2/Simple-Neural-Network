# XOR Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a neural network trained to solve the XOR logic gate problem using only NumPy.

## ðŸ§  Project Description

XOR is a classical problem that cannot be solved by a single-layer perceptron. This implementation builds a **2-layer neural network** (1 hidden layer) that learns to model XOR behavior.

### Architecture:
- Input layer: 2 neurons (for 2 input features)
- Hidden layer: 2 neurons
- Output layer: 1 neuron
- Activation function: Sigmoid
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Install NumPy if not already installed:
```bash
pip install numpy
